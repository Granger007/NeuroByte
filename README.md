# ðŸ§  NeuroByte - Early Detection and AI driven approach for detection of ADHD & Autism & Gamified approach towards Recovery



## How It Helps ?!
Early detection of ADHD and autism is **crucial** to ensuring timely interventions that improve quality of life. Traditional methods are often **slow and subjective**, leaving individuals without proper support. **NeuroByte** is here to change that through **AI-powered early detection** and **gamified recovery** strategies that make the process effective and engaging.

##  Our Game-Changing Solution
We introduce an **AI-driven, multi-layered detection and recovery system** that combines deep learning with interactive engagement:

###  **How It Works?**
 **Step 1: Early Symptom Analyzer** â€“ Users input symptoms, and AI detects patterns.
 **Step 2: MRI-Based AI Detection** â€“ If risk is detected, deep learning models analyze MRI scans for ADHD.
 **Step 3: Gaze Behavior Analysis** â€“ AI tracks gaze patterns for autism screening.
 **Step 4: Gamified Recovery** â€“ AI-powered cognitive training, mindfulness(through guided meditation sessions), memory puzzles for engagement and well-being.
 **Step 5: 5-Point Early Detection Scale** â€“ Classifies risk levels, ensuring high accuracy.

##  Why This is Revolutionary??
 **Fast & Reliable Early Diagnosis** â€“ AI-driven pattern recognition significantly reduces delays in diagnosis.
 **Gamification of Recovery** â€“ Interactive brain-training games and stress management techniques make therapy engaging.
 **AI-Driven Precision** â€“ Advanced neural networks ensure more accurate predictions using MRI & gaze behavior analysis...these accuracy values can fuurther be improved in the future by finetuning the model on a wider  scale

##  Gamified Recovery
