# 🧠 NeuroByte - Early Detection and AI driven approach for detection of ADHD & Autism & Gamified approach towards Recovery



## 🌟 How It Helps ?!
Early detection of ADHD and autism is **crucial** to ensuring timely interventions that improve quality of life. Traditional methods are often **slow and subjective**, leaving individuals without proper support. **NeuroByte** is here to change that through **AI-powered early detection** and **gamified recovery** strategies that make the process effective and engaging.

## 🚀 Our Game-Changing Solution
We introduce an **AI-driven, multi-layered detection and recovery system** that combines deep learning with interactive engagement:

### 🔎 **How It Works?**
✅ **Step 1: Early Symptom Analyzer** – Users input symptoms, and AI detects patterns.
✅ **Step 2: MRI-Based AI Detection** – If risk is detected, deep learning models analyze MRI scans for ADHD.
✅ **Step 3: Gaze Behavior Analysis** – AI tracks gaze patterns for autism screening.
✅ **Step 4: Gamified Recovery** – AI-powered cognitive training, mindfulness(through guided meditation sessions), memory puzzles for engagement and well-being.
✅ **Step 5: 5-Point Early Detection Scale** – Classifies risk levels, ensuring high accuracy.

## 🎯 Why This is Revolutionary
✨ **Fast & Reliable Early Diagnosis** – AI-driven pattern recognition significantly reduces delays in diagnosis.
✨ **Gamification of Recovery** – Interactive brain-training games and stress management techniques make therapy engaging.
✨ **AI-Driven Precision** – Advanced neural networks ensure more accurate predictions using MRI & gaze behavior analysis...these accuracy values can fuurther be improved in the future by finetuning the model on a wider  scale

## 🎮 Gamified Recovery
We believe healing should be engaging! NeuroByte includes:
- 🧩 **Personalized Brain-Training Games** tailored for ADHD & autism support.
- 🧘‍♂️ **Mindfulness & Yoga Modules** for stress and emotional regulation => thereby minimizing hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms.
- 🎯 **Progress Tracking & Adaptive Challenges** to ensure long-term benefits.
